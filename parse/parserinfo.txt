Place parsers .txt files into the parse folder
The low viewer will look for a .txt file inside it with the following name

parse\[data direction]-[hex packet id].txt

- [data direction] is either 'in' or 'out'
- [hex packet id] needs to be in 0x??? format (3 hex digits)

example:

parse\out-0x015.txt     <-- Standard Client Packet (your character's position update to the server)


The file will be parsed line by line, and if something matches, it'll show it in the program
Line format is as following

type;offset[;name[;description]]

- type are some pre-defined types in the log viewer
- offset is the byte-offset within the raw data (including the header)
  This can be in decimal format or hex format (C or Pascal)  10 = 0xA = 0x0A = $A = $0A
- name is what you want to show in the row header (optional, if ommited will display your type and offset instead)
- description is not used at this time (might use this for flags in the future)

currently supported types:

typename: file rem comment
description: nothing at all


typename: byte , char , b
description: unsigned 8 bit (1 byte) value

typename: byteflag , flag , bits
description: unsigned byte value, but also shows the value as bits

typename: word , uint16 , w
description: unsigned 16 bit (2 byte) value

typename: int16 , short
description: signed 16 bit (2 byte) value

typename: int , int32 , i
description: signed 32 bit (4 byte) value

typename: dword , long , longword , uint32 , u
description: unsigned 32 bit (4 byte) value

typename: float , f
description: 4 byte floating point number

typename: string
description: shows a null terminated string

typename: data??
description: ?? bytes or raw data displayed in Hex. (e.g. data16)

typename: ip4 , ip
description: 4 byte IP adress in 0.0.0.0 format

typename: pos
description: series of 3 floats to make XYZ coordinates

typename: dir
description: more visually appealing way of displaying a byte that is used for direction

typename: job
description: short job name

typename: ms , timestamp
description: more visually appealing way of displaying a uint32 that is used as a timestamp in milliseconds

typename: frames , frame
description: more visually appealing way of displaying a uint32 that is used as a timestamp in frames (60 second)

typename: equipslot , slot
description: Shows named version of a equipment slot byte (uses equipslot.txt)

typename: container , inventory , bag
description: Shows named version of inventory bag byte (uses containers.txt)

typename: item
description: 2 byte itemid with name (using items.txt)

typename: item-head , item-body , item-hands , item-legs , item-feet , item-main , item-sub , item-ranged
description: 2 byte itemmodelid with name (using itemmodels.txt)

typename: zone , map
description: 2 byte map name (uses zones.txt)

typename: music , bgm
description: 2 byte music number and track name (uses music.txt)

typename: weather
description: 2 byte number and weather name (uses weather.txt)



If there is unused data left in the packet past the last defined position,
the log viewer will display them all as byteflag values with their
position as a name.
