# PacketViewerLogViewer

This program is meant to be used with .log files made with the Windower4 Packetviewer addon.

The program should be pretty straight forward to use for anybody for who it would be usefull.

The end idea is to make a program that can mimic the track function for the original addon, but in a offline fashion by parsing the log files

The code was made with Delphi XE3 Starter edition, so should work on that or older without too much code adjustment.
It only uses default VCL components (can't install extra on the starter edition anyway). Shouldn't require any extra packages to be installed.
